I categorised the errors into 'model_errors' and 'annotation_errors' and prompted **Gemini 2.5 pro** to categorise 50 mistake samples into one of each category. \n\n\n**Model Errors typically occurred when:**\n\n- Predicting domains for non-domain utterances: The model incorrectly assigned domains (commonly 'hotel', 'attraction', 'train') to closing statements (\"Thank you\", \"That's all\", etc.), confirmations (\"I suppose that works\"), or other utterances that didn't contain an active request. The target for these should generally be empty ([]). (Examples: IDs 1, 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 24)\n- Hallucinating or carrying over inactive domains: The model predicted one or more domains that were not mentioned in the final utterance, sometimes alongside a correctly predicted domain. This often involved predicting 'hotel' or 'attraction' inappropriately. (Examples: IDs 0, 2, 8, 15, 21)\n- Misclassifying the correct domain: The model predicted a completely wrong domain compared to the user's explicit request in the final utterance. (Examples: IDs 4, 9, 19)\n- Failing to predict all mentioned domains: The user's utterance clearly mentioned multiple domains, but the model only predicted one. (Example: ID 12)\n- Incorrect level of granularity: The model predicted a specific type (e.g., 'museum', 'park') when the target annotation required the more general category ('attraction'). (Examples: IDs 6, 22)\n- Predicting specific entities as domains: The model included a proper name (e.g., 'chiquito restaurant') as if it were a domain category. (Example: ID 7)\n\n**Annotation Errors typically occurred when**:\n\n- Target contained unmentioned domains: The target label included a domain that was not requested or implied in the final customer utterance. (Example: ID 11, where 'restaurant' was in the target but only 'attraction' was asked for).\n- Target potentially carried over inactive domains: In some cases (like ID 2 and ID 23), the target label included domains relevant earlier in the conversation but not active in the final specific utterance being evaluated.\n\n\n**Note**\nIt's possible that I've missed something important about annotation instructions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"llm_judgements = [\n  {'id': 0, 'judgement': 'model_error'},\n  {'id': 1, 'judgement': 'model_error'},\n  {'id': 2, 'judgement':
